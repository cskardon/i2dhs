# Week 4

First we import the libraries we need:

```{r "Libraries"}
library(tidyverse)
```

Not that we actually need it as we can just do the following on its own, but it's a nice structural setup - libraries at the top, code at the bottom:

```{r "Code"}
numbers <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
squared <- numbers ^ 2
numbers
squared
```

Takes the numbers:

* 1
* 2
* 3
* 4
* 5 
* 6

and Squares them to:

1. 1
2. 4
3. 9
4. 16
5. 25
6. 36
